# Meovis – Understand Your ML Models, Visually

**Meovis** is an open-source tool that helps you visualize, explain, and compare your machine learning models with clarity — wrapped in a sleek, mascot-powered interface.

Let your models speak. **Meovis** makes it understandable.

---

## What is Meovis?

Meovis is an interactive visual assistant for:

- Visualizing classification performance (Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall)  
- Explaining model predictions with SHAP (feature importances, contributions, dependence plots)  
- Comparing multiple models side-by-side  
- Presenting your ML outputs to non-technical stakeholders in a meaningful way  
- Advanced model analytics and insights

All of this, with a dash of charm and the curiosity of our mascot — **Echo the cat**

## Technology Stack

### Backend Technologies

1. **FastAPI** (Python Web Framework)  
   RESTful API development, model loading, and prediction endpoints with automatic docs and async support.

2. **Core ML Libraries**  
   - `scikit-learn`: Model loading, metrics, feature importance  
   - `joblib`: Secure model file loading  
   - `pandas` & `numpy`: Data manipulation and numeric operations  

3. **Explainability Libraries**  
   - `SHAP`, `LIME`, `eli5` for model interpretation  

4. **Visualization & Metrics**  
   - `plotly`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn.metrics`  

5. **Data Management & Validation**  
   - `Tortoise ORM` + `PostgreSQL` for data storage  
   - `Pydantic v2` for data validation  
   - `Redis` for caching and session storage

6. **Security & Authentication**
   - `JWT` tokens with refresh mechanism
   - `bcrypt` for password hashing
   - `slowapi` for rate limiting
   - CORS protection and security headers

### Frontend Technologies

- **Next.js 14** + TypeScript for responsive UI  
- **Tailwind CSS** + **Shadcn/ui** for modern styling  
- **Recharts** + **D3.js** for rich visualizations  
- **React Dropzone** for file uploads  
- **Zustand** for state management  
- **React Query** for server state management
- **Framer Motion** for animations

### DevOps & Deployment

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for containerization
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipeline
- **Vercel** for frontend deployment
- **Railway/Render** for backend deployment
- **PostgreSQL** for production database
- **Redis** for caching and sessions
- **Sentry** for error tracking and monitoring

### Testing & Quality

- **Backend**: pytest, pytest-asyncio, httpx
- **Frontend**: Vitest, Playwright, Testing Library
- **Code Quality**: Black, isort, Ruff, ESLint, Prettier
- **Git Hooks**: Husky, lint-staged, conventional commits
